## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a project done as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It is used to present techniques learnt doing the course. The dataset has been provided by Udacity.

## Files Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three .py files here necessary to run the project. In the 'data' folder there is a 'process_data' Python code taking care of the data preparation and saving output in the database. Datasets used in this step are included in this folder.
The 'models' folder consists of .py file with the code responsible for training of the ML model, while the classifier.pkl file includes parameters of the saved trained model.
The 'app' folder includes code necessary to run WebApp.
